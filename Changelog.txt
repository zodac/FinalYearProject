KeyAnalyser v0.2 - Based on photobyintent project on developer.android website

Changes:
=======
• "Take Video" button now saves at programmed location (/sdcard/KeyAnalyser_tmp)
• Images now stored in subfolder (/sdcard/KeyAnalyser_tmp/tmp_images).
• "Process" button loads this file, not test file.
• WHILE loop changed to FOR loop. Uses length of video to determine how many iterations.
• Image filenames now saved with the name in 00x format.
• App name changed from "photobyintent" to "KeyAnalyser".

Bugs:
====
• FOR loop crashes after x iterations (usually with x = 19) with a NULL pointer error. Using a break to continue, but needs to be looked at. Possible help at #android-dev on freenode.

Solved Bugs:
=========
• vidLength currently pulling 9s on a 7s video - needs to be investigated. Constant 2s or %, or deeper issue?
• Problem with precision of frame extraction - images only updating every 2s from video file - maximum of 4 distint images from 7s video. Limitation of MMdR class?
