photobyintent v0.1 - Based on photobyintent project on developer.android website

Changes:
=======
• Add "Process" button to main screen (keep big/small image and video buttons).
• Add toasts to confirm full run through of "dispatchProcVideoIntent" method.
• Load video file using "MediaMetadataRetriever" class.
• Add new directory for image files at /sdcard/PhotoIntentStorage.
• Pull length of video using .METADATA_KEY_DURATION.
• WHILE loop extracting a bmp image every 0.1s from video file using .getFrameAtTime().
• Use bmp.compress to convert bmp file to png and put into byte stream.
• Save file at location, using a counter "image" for filename.
• Write bytes to location.
• Flush byte stream, increment counters.

Bugs:
====
• vidLength currently pulling 9s on a 7s video - needs to be investigated. Constant 2s or %, or deeper issue?
• Problem with precision of frame extraction - images only updating every 2s from video file - maximum of 4 distint images from 7s video. Limitation of MMdR class?
